Write the R code that:  
  - Creates a vector (called `exam_scores`) that has the numbers 100, 85, 96, and 91.  
  - Adds 5 from each of the numbers in the vector  
  - Calculate the standard deviation of the elements in `exam_scores`  
  
The output from the calculation should go to the R console
```{r}
exam_scores <- c(100, 85, 96, 91)
exam_scores + 5
sd(exam_scores) #sd stands for standard deviation 
```
Write an SQL statement that computes the mean score from a data frame with the name exam_score.
sqlfd(select avg(score) from exam_scores)
```in order to compute this function, you must also run library(sqldf)```
